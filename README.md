1. FindingFiveGen
This repository contains the python codes that could generate corresponding FindingFive inputs (stimuli.csv, response.csv, trial_templates.txt, procedure.txt) as well as some helper files souch as praat (the audio stimuli required). This is specially designed for minature artificial language experiments. The researchers need to provide study_design.csv file where researchers specify their experimental designs and input_language.csv file where researchers specify their designed minature artificial language with a specialized format.
